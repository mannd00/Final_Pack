# Google AIY Voice Kit

This was a fun little Linux projet! Google Released a build it yourself kit for making your own Google Home AI Assistant. It uses a RaspberryPi and they offer a premade Raspbian image that has some of their Google software installed.

Using the guide found on Google official AIY project site (Here)[https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice] I was able to get a fully functioning Google Assistant!

Since this has a fully functional RaspberryPi inside, I plan on usign it to host other things, such as a website, or maybe Minecraft or Doom!

Endless Possibilities.
